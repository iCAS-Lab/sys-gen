# sys-gen: An Arbitrary Precision Systolic Array Generator

**SYS-GEN** or <ins>**SYS**</ins>tolic Array <ins>**GEN**</ins>erator is a Python tool that generates Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code in the Verilog High Description Language (HDL) for implementing systolic arrays of arbitrary bit precision. The Verilog code is verifiable and synthesizable by using the tool's automatically generated testbenches in tools such as Synopsys Design Compiler and in the Vitis/Vivado AMD-Xilinx tools. Additionally, the tool dynamically generates TCL scripts to run different synthesis routines easily (right now the tool only generates a timing closure TCL script, but more TCL scripts supporting different optimizations will be added in the future).

In the future, SYS-GEN will support more than systolic arrays. It will help define more digital designs after we build up the basic logic modules. At this point, **SYS-GEN** will be migrated from <ins>**SYS**</ins>tolic Array <ins>**GEN**</ins>erator to a digital <ins>**SYS**</ins>tem <ins>**GEN**</ins>erator.

```

## Quickstart:

Initialize the Python environment using the packages included in `env.yml`:

```
conda env create -f ./env.yml
```

Run the following command to generate a simple 32x32 8-bit integer Output-Stationary (OS) systolic array.

```
python src/main.py
```

The resulting generated code can be found in the `experiment` directory as follows:

```
experiment
├── config_2025-03-31 18:42:56.413556.json
├── logs
├── reports
├── rtl
│   ├── demux_1_to_32.v
│   ├── fifo.v
│   ├── integer_mac_pe.v
│   ├── mux_1024_to_1.v
│   └── systolic_array_32x32.v
├── script_systolic_array_32x32.tcl
└── work
```

- `experiment` - root project directory for using in synthesis tools.
- `config_2025-03-31 18:42:56.413556.json` - Configuration file for reproducing results.
- `logs` - directory for logs.
- `reports` - directory for synthesis results.
- `rtl` - location of the Verilog code.
- `script_systolic_array_32x32.tcl` - script for synthesizing the design in Synopsys Design Compiler.
- `work` - directory for generated design files.

For some sample code generated by the tool see the contents of the [`output_sample`](output_sample/) directory.

## TCL Scripts

The tool has a built in TCL script generator which generates a timing closure TCL script for optimizing the design timing.

## Tools Supported for Synthesis

- Support for Synopsys Design Compiler V-2023.12-SP5
- Support for Vitis/Vivado 2024.2 (TBD)

## Deployment

In the future, we hope to further develop this pipeline to deploy the synthesized designs onto Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) utilizing libraries like PYNQ.

## Current Limitations/Caveats/TODOs:

- Support multiple TCL script configurations
- Create an option to disable timing closure loop in TCL script
- TCL Script needs to be parameterized and integrated into the config
- Configurations are not able to be read in and need to be further developed
- Need to implement Fixed-Point and Floating-Point architectures
- Need to ensure that logic is signed for weights and membrane potential
- More than one type of design optimization (Area? Power? etc.)
- Add systolic arrays with different dataflows (IS and WS)
- Currently, the outputs of the PEs is truncated to the same input bitwidth. Need to parameterize this.
- Make the code interoperable with [SCALE Sim v2](https://github.com/scalesim-project/scale-sim-v2)
